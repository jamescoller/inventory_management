# Inventory Management — TODO / Roadmap

Items are grouped by phase. Within each phase, bugs before enhancements.
File:line references reflect the codebase as of May 2026.

---

## Phase 1 — Critical Bug Fixes

These are confirmed crashes or security holes in currently-reachable code.

### Bugs

- [x] **Search crashes on every request** — added `import re` to views.py.
- [x] **Barcode print redirect broken** — fixed kwarg from `pk=` to `item_id=` in `PrintBarcodeView.post` and `BarcodeRedirectView.get`.
- [x] **Every new Printer crashes on save** — added `bed_length_mm`, `bed_width_mm`, `max_height_mm` to `PrinterForm.Meta.fields`.
- [x] **Admin dropdowns crash when any Filament has no Material** — added null guard in `Filament.__str__`.
- [x] **Bulk update material admin action broken** — changed `queryset.update(new_matl=material)` to `queryset.update(material=material)`.
- [x] **Hex code normalization silently broken** — fixed regex in `normalize_hex_code()` to match stripped (no-`#`) value.
- [x] **Filament drying warning never fires** — changed `self.status == "NEW"` to `self.status == self.Status.NEW`.
- [x] **Fix `DEBUG` env var cast** — added `cast=bool` to `config("DEBUG", ...)`.
- [x] **Excel export broken** — fixed `item.location.name` crash when location is None.
- [x] **`import_products.py` is orphaned and broken** — deleted. `numpy`/`pandas` removal deferred to Phase 3.

### Security

- [x] **Debug toolbar exposed in production** — wrapped `debug_toolbar` in `if DEBUG:` guards in `settings.py` (INSTALLED_APPS + MIDDLEWARE) and `urls.py`.
- [x] **Stored XSS via chart labels** — replaced `{{ filament_chart_data.labels|safe }}` / `{{ filament_chart_data.data|safe }}` with `json_script` filter + `JSON.parse` in dashboard.html.
- [x] **Stored XSS via tooltip HTML** — run `serial_number` and `color` through `django.utils.html.escape()` before building `tooltip_html` in both `InUseOverviewView` and `DryStorageOverviewView`.
- [x] **Missing `LoginRequiredMixin`** — added to `PrintBarcodeView`, `BarcodeRedirectView`, `InUseOverviewView`, `DryStorageOverviewView`.

---

## Phase 2 — Dead Code Removal & Cleanup

Safe to delete without any user-visible impact.

### Delete entirely

- [x] `tables.py` — deleted; `django-tables2` removed from requirements and INSTALLED_APPS.
- [x] `FilamentView` in views.py + `filament_view.html` — deleted.
- [x] `Order` and `Shipment` models — deleted from models.py and admin.py; migration 0020 drops their DB tables.
- [x] `inventory/import_products.py` — deleted in Phase 1.
- [x] `inventory/templates/inventory/bulkadd.html` — deleted.
- [x] `inventory/templates/inventory/delete_item.html` — deleted.
- [x] `inventory/templates/inventory/search_results.html` — deleted.
- [x] `inventory/templates/inventory/movement.html` — deleted.
- [x] Commented-out URL patterns in `inventory/urls.py` — removed.
- [x] `format_label` and `generate_barcode` in `barcode_utils.py` — deleted and removed from `__all__`.
- [x] Hardcoded fallback printer IP `"192.168.68.93"` — replaced with correct LAN address `"10.10.40.2"`.

### Fix `from X import *` antipattern

- [x] Replace `from .models import *` in views.py with explicit imports.
- [x] Replace `from .forms import *` in views.py with explicit imports.
- [x] Replace `from .models import *` in forms.py with explicit imports.

### Wire up or fix signals.py

- [x] `inventory/apps.py` `ready()` now imports `inventory.signals`.
- [x] Fixed `StatusChoices` typo → `Status`; switched from `post_save` to `pre_save` so old state is read from DB before the write.

### Redundant boolean fields

- [x] `depleted`, `in_use`, `sold` converted to `@property` on `InventoryItem`; DB columns dropped in migration 0020; admin `list_filter` updated.

---

## Phase 3 — Code Quality & Architecture

### Views

- [x] **Consolidate the 5 Add Product views** — extracted `BaseAddProductView` mixin; each of the 5 subclasses is now ~5 lines.
- [x] **Fix Dashboard N+1 queries** — replaced Python-side table scans with `values().annotate(Count(...))` DB aggregations.
- [x] **Move UPC lookup logic out of `AddInventoryView.post()`** — replaced 10-line subclass loop with `Product.objects.filter(upc=upc).first()` (polymorphic queryset returns real instance directly).
- [x] **Standardize CBV naming** — `inventoryEditView` → `InventoryEditView`, `addInventoryView` → `AddInventoryView`.

### Models / Forms

- [x] **Move hex validation to `Filament.clean()` + `FilamentForm.clean_hex_code()`** — invalid hex now shows as a form field error instead of a 500.
- [x] **Move printer dimension validation to `Printer.clean()`** — removed `ValueError` from `Printer.save()`.
- [x] **Fix `InventoryItem.save()` location-change detection** — added `from_db()` to store `_original_location_id`; `save()` compares against it instead of doing an extra SELECT.

### Templates

- [x] **Consolidate the 5 near-identical add-product templates** — replaced with single `add_product.html` that uses `{{ form_title }}` / `{{ submit_label }}` context vars.
- [x] **Fix JS load order in `base.html`** — moved all JS library `<script>` tags before `{% block extra_scripts %}` so child template scripts always have jQuery/Bootstrap/Chart.js available.
- [x] **Deduplicate DataTables CSS** — removed duplicate `<link>` (was in both `<head>` and after content block).
- [x] **`in_use_overview.html` and `dry_storage_overview.html`** — extracted shared filament card body into `includes/filament_item_body.html` (show_name/show_location flags); tooltip init into `includes/tooltip_init.html`.

### Admin

- [x] **Fix `field` → `fields` typo** in `HardwareAdmin`, `DryerAdmin`, `AMSAdmin`.
- [x] **Fix `DryerAdmin.field`** — corrected `'max_temp"degC'` → `'max_temp_degC'`.
- [x] **Fix `display_product_details`** — fixed wrong reverse-accessor patterns; serial number now read from `obj` (InventoryItem) not from the product subclass.
- [x] **Fix `ShipmentAdmin`** — already deleted in Phase 2 along with the Shipment model.
- [x] **Fix `mark_depleted` admin action** — now iterates queryset and calls `instance.mark_depleted(); instance.save()` so `date_depleted` and `location` are kept in sync.
- [x] **Fix `view_log`** — replaced `f.readlines()[-200:]` (reads whole file) with `subprocess + tail -n 200`.

### Dependencies to clean up (after dead code removal)

- [x] Remove `numpy` and `pandas` — done in Phase 2 (import_products.py deleted).
- [x] Remove `django-tables2` — done in Phase 2 (tables.py deleted).
- [x] Move `pre-commit` and `django-debug-toolbar` to a `requirements-dev.txt`.
- [x] Pin `python-barcode`, `brother_ql`, `python-decouple` to explicit minimum versions.
- [x] Remove `setuptools` from app requirements.

### Tests

- [ ] Add `tests.py` basics — at minimum one round-trip per view and one `save()` per model. The number of latent bugs caught by the analysis above suggests zero test coverage currently.

### Bugs

- [x] On view (`FilamentSummaryView`):
  - [x] Material cards at the top of the page are sorted alphabetically by material name, instead of by the number of filament rolls in the inventory.
  - [x] Color of the black swatches in the filament cards is approximately `#2c3e50` instead of `#000000`.
  - [x] ** Enhancement: ** Center the filament cards and the totals cards on the page instead of having them flush to the left.
  - [x] Missing filters for `subtype` on the table. This can be added just above the table on the left side. Add filters for material and color family here as well.
  - [x] In the table, change the word `family` to `color family` in the column headers.
  - [x] On the used filters (`7d`, `30d`, `1y`), the selected filter is shown by removing the border of the button. This is hard to see. Leave the border on and instead invert the colors of the font and background of the button.
  - [x] Some colors, such as `TPU 95A HF` show the color written Black, but the color swatch is White. This could be due to the color hex not being written in the individual DB entries. Investigate and fix.

## Phase 4 — Features & Enhancements

### Open GitHub Issues

- [ ] **#47 — Improve Item ID barcode rendering** — INV-XXX barcodes are hard for scanners to read. Investigate `module_width_mm` tuning in `barcode_utils.py`; compare rendered output against a known-good P-touch label. May need to adjust quiet zone or bar height ratio.
- [ ] **#48 — Location barcodes (LOC-XXX)** — Add `barcode` field or auto-generated `LOC-{id}` code to the `Location` model; extend `PrintBarcodeView` to handle location objects; add a print button to the location admin/detail page.
- [ ] **#49 — Location-based views** — `Location` already has `default_status` and `is_printer`. Build views to: list all items at a location, and edit an item's location from that view. Natural companion to #48.
- [ ] **#38 — Show spool boolean in inventory editor** — `Filament.has_spool` exists on the model; add it to `InventoryEditForm.Meta.fields` and the edit template.
- [ ] **#34 — Import order/invoice history** — Fix and relocate `import_products.py` to `management/commands/`. Add `add_arguments` for file path. Consider replacing pandas with openpyxl (already a dependency) to drop the heavy dep.
- [ ] **#33 — Excel export broken** — Fix `InventoryExportView`. *(Also listed in Phase 1)*
- [ ] **#65 — View 3MF files in the web portal** — Use `three.js` + `Online3DViewer` (https://github.com/kovacsv/Online3DViewer). Significant work; consider as a standalone feature branch.

### Cleanup & Refactoring

- [ ] Remove searching for the barcode printer by MAC address; simply use the static IP address (`10.10.40.2`).

### New Capabilities

- [x] **Bulk inventory editor** — Added checkbox selection to the Search Inventory page with a sticky action bar to apply status, location, and/or shipment changes to multiple items at once. Uses `POST /bulk-update/` (`BulkUpdateView`), a JS `Set` as selection source of truth (survives DataTables page changes), and iterates with `item.save()` to preserve all side-effects (`mark_depleted`, `mark_sold`, location-driven status). Pagination options of 25/50/100/All. Filter params round-trip through redirect.

- [ ] **Phone camera barcode scanning** — Two approaches:
  - *Browser-based (recommended, no app needed):* Integrate `@zxing/browser` JS library; wire a camera-capture modal to the existing search/inventory flow via HTMX. Works on any phone browser.
  - *Native:* Chrome/Edge Android has a built-in `BarcodeDetector` API (no library) but Safari doesn't support it.
  - Pairs with #48 (location barcodes) — scan a LOC-XXX to pull up a location page, scan an INV-XXX to pull up an item.

- [ ] **BambuLab API integration** — Connect to printers on the local LAN via MQTT (same protocol the HACS `bambu_lab` integration uses). Key data to pull:
  - Current print job and progress
  - AMS slot assignments (which filament spool is loaded in which slot)
  - Temperatures and status
  - *Highest-value automation:* on print completion, auto-update which spool is in which AMS slot and optionally decrement estimated remaining weight.
  - Reference: HACS bambu_lab integration source for the MQTT topic structure.

- [ ] **Filament Selection Guide** – Add an interactive guide in the web portal to help users select the right filament for their needs. Key information:
  - UV Resistance
  - Printability
  - Drying Time / Need
  - Colors Available
  - Structural Need
  - Flexibility / Ductility (Thinking about TPU vs others)

- [ ] **Bambu Store Integration** — Add a link to the Bambu Store to entries for quick re-ordering. (`us.store.bambulab.com`)
  - Use search by SKU to find the item in the store.
  - Load current prices into the web portal.
  - Create ability to alert for sales and low stock levels using HA.
  - Allow metadata updates for products, such as price, color hex code, drying times and temperatures, etc.

- [ ] **HA Integraton** — Integrate DB visualization in a HA dashboard using Grafana.

- [x] **Improved data visualizations** — Dashboard now has 3 charts (product type, filament by material, filament by color family with real hex colors); low-stock alert table with urgency tiers (Out of Stock / Running Low / Low Stock) cross-referenced against 30-day depletion history; new `/filament-color-guide/` page showing all on-hand filament spools grouped by color family, printable as PDF.
  - [ ] Filament usage over time (requires logging consumption events)
  - [ ] Spool weight distribution (how much of each color/material is on hand by weight)
  - [ ] Printer utilization (requires BambuLab integration)

- [x] **Filament summary view** — Added `material_type` field to `Material` model (migrations 0021/0022); data migration splits compound names (e.g. "ABS+ (Matte)" → name "ABS+", type "Matte"); `MaterialAdmin` updated with `list_editable` for `material_type` and correct `list_display_links`; new `/filament-summary/` view (`FilamentSummaryView`) aggregates inventory into per-material cards showing roll counts by time period (all-time / 90-day / 30-day) and top colors; nav link added; filament_summary.html uses DataTables + JS period toggle for interactive filtering.

- [ ] **Status-based location assignment** ✅ *(Already implemented in `InventoryItem.save()` via `Location.default_status` — the original todo item is done)*

### Reusable App Extraction (longer term)

- [ ] **Extract `barcode_utils.py` as a standalone `brother_ql_utils` package** — zero Django coupling, clean public API, useful beyond this project.
- [ ] **Extract polymorphic inventory core** (`Product`, `InventoryItem`, `Location`, `Material`, status-by-location) into a reusable `polymorphic_inventory` app once filament-specific logic is isolated in subclasses.

---

## Aspirational / Backlog

- [ ] Sphinx docs + GitHub Pages deployment *(original todo item — low priority)*
- [ ] Per-user inventory scoping — `user` FK was deliberately removed in migration 0013; fine for single-household use but worth revisiting if multi-user support is wanted.
- [ ] Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL if concurrent write performance becomes a concern.
- [ ] `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` driven by env vars instead of hardcoded.
- [ ] HTTPS + `SECURE_*` Django settings if the app is ever exposed outside the LAN.
