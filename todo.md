# 🛠️ Inventory Management Project Recommendations

Below is an organized and prioritized list of recommended actions based on your stated project goals and the current state of your Django-based Inventory Management system.

---

## 🎯 1. Deployment Automation

**Objective**: Automate deployment to your Synology NAS using GitHub Actions.

- **Set up GitHub Actions Runner**
  - Install Docker on your Synology NAS.
  - Use [`myoung34/github-runner`](https://hub.docker.com/r/myoung34/github-runner).
  - Register as a self-hosted runner.

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**
  ```yaml
  name: Deploy Inventory App

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - master

  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: self-hosted
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
        - run: |
            docker-compose build
            docker-compose up -d
  ```

## 🎯 2. User Experience Enhancements

**Objective**: Simplify inventory tasks using barcode scanning.

- **Optimized Workflow**
  - Receiving: shipment barcode → UPC scanning.
  - Transfers: item barcode → location barcode.

- **Frontend Improvements**
  - Auto-focus barcode fields.
  - Auto-submit on barcode scan completion.
  - Immediate visual feedback on scans.

---

## 🎯 3. Inventory Analytics Dashboard

- **Real-Time Dashboard**
  - Product counts by type/location.
  - Usage trends and top-used items.

- **Visualization Tools**
  - Chart.js or Plotly.

---

## 🎯 4. Barcode Generation & Printing

- **Barcode Generation (Python)**
  ```python
  import barcode
  from barcode.writer import ImageWriter

  def generate_barcode(sku, path):
      ean = barcode.get('code128', sku, writer=ImageWriter())
      ean.save(path)
  ```

- **Automated Printing (Brother QL-810)**
  ```python
  from brother_ql.raster import BrotherQLRaster
  from brother_ql.backends.helpers import send

  def print_label(image_path):
      qlr = BrotherQLRaster('QL-810W')
      instructions = qlr.convert([image_path], label='62', rotate='90')
      send(instructions, printer_identifier='usb://0x04f9:0x209b', backend_identifier='pyusb')
  ```

---

## 🎯 5. Documentation with Sphinx & GitHub Pages

- **Sphinx Setup**
  ```bash
  pip install sphinx sphinx-autodoc-typehints sphinx-rtd-theme
  sphinx-quickstart docs
  ```

- **GitHub Actions for Docs Deployment**
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build-docs:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
          with:
            python-version: '3.11'
        - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
        - run: cd docs && make html
        - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
          with:
            github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            publish_dir: ./docs/_build/html
  ```
